# k-Nearest Neighbours
This is a repository that contains the code for the k-nearest neighbours algorithm coded from scratch for CS-1390 [Intruduction to Machine Learning]. Here we will use a value of k=5. To run the code, first place the dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/code/waltermaffy/fruit-classification-pca-svm-knn-decision-tree/notebook in the following folder ```./knn/input```.
